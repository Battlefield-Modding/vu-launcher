# Unofficial VU Launcher
## What?
A launcher for Battlefield 3: Venice Unleashed.
It is made with Tauri and React.
## Why?
Trying to learn Tauri/React and I want to make it easier to use Venice Unleashed.
Some QoL improvements that I want:
- Easy installation of mods
- Easy configuration of server
- Easy swapping between server configurations (loadouts)
- Easy adding of launch arguments including auto login, auto server join, etc
## How to use?
The launcher cannot be used yet as it is early in development.
