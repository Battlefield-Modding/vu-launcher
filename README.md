## What?
A WIP launcher for Battlefield 3: Venice Unleashed. Mostly useful if playing VU locally or developing mods.
### Features:
- Do stuff in one place
  - No more digging through directories to find txt files / mod folders
  - No more looking up documentation to change things like maplist
- Server Loadouts
  - Quickly swap between different server configurations (startup/maplist/modlist/banlist).
  - Replaces manual .txt config with forms so you don't have to worry about typos
  - Server import. You can drag and drop an existing config right into the launcher.
  - Buttons for common actions like starting server / server + client.
  - Mod import. You can drag and drop a valid mod into a server loadout
- Translation support with i18n
## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Battlefield 3
- Windows

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Battlefield-Modding/vu-launcher/releases) section and get the latest `.exe` file.
Alternatively download the source code and build it yourself.
## Why?
Trying to learn Tauri/React and I want to make it easier to use Venice Unleashed.
Some QoL improvements that I wanted:
- Easier installation of mods
- Easier configuration of server
- Easier swapping between server configurations (loadouts)
- Easier adding of launch arguments including auto login, auto server join, etc
