![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5bec60c-8693-4bce-a454-bed41ec6ca50)
## What?
A WIP launcher for Battlefield 3: Venice Unleashed. Mostly useful if playing VU locally or developing mods.
### Features:
- Install VU
- Guided server setup
- Server Loadouts
  - Quickly swap between different server configurations (startup/maplist/modlist/banlist).
  - Change parts of the loadout with guided forms, instead of manually typing in a `.txt` file.
  - Import an existing server configuration. This will copy everything and rename the mod folders.
  - Buttons for common actions like starting server / server + client.
- Import zipped mod folders which can then be added to any loadout.
- Activate BF3
## Why?
Trying to learn Tauri/React and I want to make it easier to use Venice Unleashed.
Some QoL improvements that I wanted:
- Easier installation of mods
- Easier configuration of server
- Easier swapping between server configurations (loadouts)
- Easier adding of launch arguments including auto login, auto server join, etc
## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Battlefield 3
- Windows

Go to the releases section and get the latest `.exe` file.
Alternatively download the source code and build it yourself.
